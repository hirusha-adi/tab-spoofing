# Tab Spoofer

Tab Spoofer is a JavaScript-based solution that allows you to manipulate the title and favicon of your browser tab when it is not in focus (i.e., when the user switches to another tab). This is done to mimic the look of popular websites like "Gmail", "WhatsApp", and others, making it less suspicious to anyone observing the open tab.

#### Features:

- **Random Tab Spoofing:** When the tab is not in focus, the title and favicon change randomly to a predefined set of websites (e.g., Gmail, Facebook, X, Yahoo Mail, etc.).
- **Restoration on Focus:** When the tab is active again, the original title and favicon are restored.
- **Customizable:** Easily add or remove spoofing options by modifying a simple array in the code.

#### How It Works:

1. When the tab becomes inactive (e.g., when the user switches to another tab), the title and favicon are replaced with a randomly selected value from a list of popular websites.
2. When the tab becomes active again, the original title and favicon are restored.
3. You can easily modify the list of spoofing options by editing an array in the script, adding new websites or removing unwanted ones.

#### How to Use:

You can use the Tab Spoofer script in any project. Click on the folders above to open the required version.
