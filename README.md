# Tab Spoofer

**Tab Spoofer** is a fun little JS script that helps you change the title and favicon of your browser tab when it's not in focus. This way, if someone looks at your screen while you’re away from the tab, it’ll look like you’re on a popular website like Gmail, Facebook, or WhatsApp, making it less obvious that you're working on something else.

#### Key Features:

- **Random Tab Spoofing:** When your tab is inactive (i.e., when you switch to another tab), it randomly picks a website from a predefined list, changing both the tab’s title and its favicon. Think of it like switching between Gmail, Facebook, or Yahoo Mail—no one will know the difference.
- **Restoration on Focus:** As soon as you come back to the tab, it’ll restore your original title and favicon, just like you never left.
- **Customizable:** Want to add your own spoofing sites or remove some? No problem! It’s super easy to tweak the list of websites by editing just a simple array in the script.

#### How It Works:

1. When your tab loses focus (for example, when you switch to another tab), it grabs a random website from a list and changes the tab’s title and favicon to look like that website.
2. Once you click back on the tab, it goes back to the original title and favicon you had.
3. You can easily edit the list of websites used for spoofing by changing a few lines in the script.

#### How to Use:

It’s simple to add **Tab Spoofer** to any project. Just follow the instructions in the tabs above to pick the version you need.
