# [Tab Spoofer - Example] ReactJS + Vite

This is the default template generated by Vite. The `TabSpoofer.jsx` file has been added to `./src/components/`, and `./src/main.jsx` has been modified. This means that even if I add more routes (e.g., using react-router), the tab spoofing will be applied globally across all of them.
